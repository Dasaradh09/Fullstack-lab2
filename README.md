Experience

Making a powerful express contact database has been so good. This is simple contacts database where you can manage all contacts in one place. For obtaining data I have used forms and data is saved on json file which is easier to see the all given information regarding contact. I have managed to apply some styling through bootstrap and made it look even good. Hanging routes and render is on big task I got through in this project. But later on Iâ€™m able to fix everything and run it successfully.
